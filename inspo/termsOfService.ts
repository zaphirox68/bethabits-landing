Bet Habits Terms of Service  
Effective 18 April 2025  |  Last revised 4 May 2025

1. Agreement  
By creating an account or using the Bet Habits mobile application ("Service") you form a binding contract with the sole proprietor trading as "Bet Habits" ("we", "us"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.

2. Eligibility  
You must be **18 years or older** and legally capable of entering contracts in your country of residence.

3. How the Service works  
You set a measurable, time‑boxed goal and choose **one** verifier:  
• **AI verifier** (automated model), or  
• **Peer verifier** (one friend you invite).  
If the goal is **verified as achieved**, no money is charged.  
If the goal **fails verification**, the stake you selected is charged to your payment method and retained by us as an administrative fee. No funds are reserved, blocked, or pre‑authorised before failure.

4. Verification & Appeals  
The verifier's decision is final unless you file an appeal within 48 hours via Settings → **Contact Us**. Appeals are reviewed manually and our ruling is binding.

5. Your Obligations  
• Set clear, specific goals.  
• Upload only content you have the right to share.  
• Avoid illegal, harmful, or privacy‑invasive content.  
• Accept the verdict of the chosen verifier unless appealed.

6. Financial Terms  
• **Stake limits:** USD 5 minimum, USD 10 000 maximum per goal.  
• **Payment capture:** Card details are tokenised by Stripe at goal creation; the stake is captured **only** if the goal fails verification.  
• **No partial refunds** once a goal is marked as failed.  
• **Cancellation:** You may cancel a goal in Dashboard → Goal details → Cancel *before* its start time; cancellation is impossible after the deadline begins.  
• **Taxes:** While Bet Habits remains below the Austrian small‑business threshold (€35 000) and the EU micro‑business threshold (€10 000 cross‑border digital services), **no VAT is charged**. If these limits are exceeded, VAT or sales tax will be added where legally required (see § 11).

7. Account Suspension  
We may suspend or terminate your account—and collect any outstanding stakes—if we detect fraud, abuse, or breach of these Terms.

8. Intellectual Property  
The Service's code, design, and trademarks are ours. You keep ownership of content you upload but grant us a non‑exclusive, worldwide licence to store, display, and process it solely for verification.

9. Disclaimer  
The Service provides no medical, psychological, or financial advice and is offered "as is". Use it at your own risk.

10. Limitation of Liability  
Our total liability is limited to the greater of (i) USD 100 or (ii) the stakes you forfeited in the 12 months preceding the claim. We are not liable for indirect or consequential damages.

11. Taxes  
If Bet Habits exceeds (i) the Austrian small‑business exemption (€35 000 total turnover), (ii) the EU digital‑services micro‑threshold (€10 000 cross‑border B2C), or (iii) a U.S. state's economic‑nexus threshold (e.g. USD 100 000 sales or 200 transactions), forfeited stakes will be treated as consideration for a digital service and local VAT or sales tax will be collected via the EU One‑Stop Shop or Stripe Tax. 

12. Governing Law & Disputes  
These Terms are governed by Austrian law. Exclusive venue is Vienna, except where consumer‑protection rules grant you the right to sue in your home jurisdiction. U.S. users may bring claims in small‑claims court or choose binding arbitration under the AAA Consumer Rules.

13. Changes  
Material changes to these Terms will appear in‑app at least 14 days before they take effect. Continued use after that date constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
