Submit any request via **Contact Us** in the app or e‑mail bethabitsoffice@gmail.com. We answer within 30 days.

7. Security  
All traffic runs over HTTPS / TLS 1.2+. Files are AES‑256 encrypted at rest. Role‑based rules restrict staff access.

9. Automated decisions  
When AI verification is selected, the model returns a pass/fail result that may automatically forfeit your stake. You may request a human review within 48 h via the goal detail screen.

10. Changes  
Material changes are announced in‑app at least 14 days before they take effect. Continued use after that date constitutes acceptance of the amended policy.
